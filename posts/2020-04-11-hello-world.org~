* Kia ora koutou
This is the first post on what will hopefully become a
regularly updated personal blog. I'm not currently
interested in making this blog look pretty, that can
come later when I have a few posts written up.
* Who am I?
My name is Amber Bohanna. I'm currently doing Honours
in mathematics at Victoria University.
